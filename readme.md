# Welcome to Planet Capitalism

## Installation

To run the game and because it is not host on a server you need to start it by yourself using this line
```
npm run dev
```
If it is not starting it is maybe the fact that this project is using __webpack__ and __node.js__ so don't forget to check it out before complaining

## Game Progress

- Start by choosing your planet (3 types so you can make this planet your true home)

- Some random guy tell you how the game is working

- Start building with a crazy budget of 10 000 $

- Become richer and richer and richer and richer...

- Delete everything because it really looks bad and start over

## All the features

- 3D planets turning on themselves in the menu

- A raycasting working grid (6x11) that show where your mouse is and allows you to build on it

- Up to 4 models to build in your map

- 2 counters of both number of peoples and money you have

- A free moving camera
